## Financial Analysis & ROI Frameworks

### Total Cost of Ownership: 3-Year Model

| Solution Type | Initial Implementation | Annual Licensing | Operational Costs | Total 3-Year TCO |
|---------------|------------------------|------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Pure SaaS (Basic) | $5,000-$15,000 | $12,000-$36,000 | $8,000-$20,000 | $41,000-$127,000 |
| Pure SaaS (Enterprise) | $20,000-$50,000 | $36,000-$120,000 | $15,000-$40,000 | $127,000-$350,000 |
| Component-Based (Basic) | $30,000-$70,000 | $24,000-$60,000 | $40,000-$80,000 | $166,000-$370,000 |
| Component-Based (Advanced) | $80,000-$150,000 | $48,000-$120,000 | $60,000-$150,000 | $284,000-$750,000 |
| Custom-Built | $150,000-$300,000 | $36,000-$80,000 | $100,000-$200,000 | $436,000-$980,000 |

### ROI Calculation Model (Customer Support Example)

```
ROI = ((Labor Savings + CSAT Value + Volume Scaling) - TCO) / TCO

Where:
- Labor Savings = (Avg Support Hours × % Reduced × Hourly Cost)
- CSAT Value = (Increased CSAT % × Customer Value Impact)
- Volume Scaling = (Additional Volume Handled Without Staffing)
- TCO = Total Cost of Ownership
```

**Example Calculation:**
- Support team of 10 FTEs ($50/hour fully loaded)
- RAG chatbot reduces workload by 30%
- 1% CSAT improvement ($100,000 revenue impact)
- DocsBot AI Business plan ($199/month) + Implementation ($15,000)
- 3-year ROI: 418% ($312,400 net benefit)
