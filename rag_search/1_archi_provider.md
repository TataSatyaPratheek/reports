This analysis deconstructs each architecture's components, identifies leading providers, estimates costs for processing 100K pages monthly, and provides strategic assessments through multiple analytical frameworks.

## RAG Architectures: Components and Workflow Analysis

### Naive RAG Architecture

Naive RAG represents the simplest implementation of retrieval-augmented generation, following a straightforward linear workflow:

1. **Document Processing**: Ingestion and chunking of documents into manageable segments
2. **Embedding**: Converting document chunks into vector representations using embedding models
3. **Indexing**: Storing these vector representations in a vector database
4. **Query Processing**: Converting user queries into the same vector space
5. **Retrieval**: Finding relevant document chunks based on vector similarity
6. **Generation**: Feeding retrieved context along with the query to a language model for response generation

Naive RAG operates under a "retrieve-then-generate" paradigm without additional optimization techniques[17]. This architecture excels in simplicity but lacks mechanisms for ensuring high-quality retrieval or addressing complex queries.

### Retrieve-and-Rerank Architecture

This architecture enhances the basic RAG pipeline by adding a crucial refinement step:

1. **Initial Retrieval**: Similar to Naive RAG, initial retrieval based on vector similarity
2. **Reranking**: Using a more powerful model to rerank retrieved documents based on relevance
3. **Filtering**: Selecting only the highest-ranked documents for generation
4. **Generation**: Using the filtered, high-quality context for response generation

Rerankers significantly improve retrieval quality by addressing limitations of vector search. As explained in search result[6], "Re-ranking is typically used as a second stage after an initial fast retrieval step, ensuring that only the most relevant documents are presented to the user."[6][20]

### Multimodal RAG

Multimodal RAG extends retrieval capabilities beyond text to include images, audio, and other media types:

1. **Multimodal Document Processing**: Handling diverse content types including images, audio, etc.
2. **Unified Embeddings**: Converting different modalities into a shared embedding space
3. **Multimodal Retrieval**: Finding relevant content across modality types
4. **Multimodal Generation**: Producing responses that may include or reference multiple modalities

This architecture enables "any-to-any search and retrieval" where "any of the modalities understood and embedded by the multimodal model can be passed in as a query and objects of any modality that are conceptually similar can be returned."[7]

### Graph RAG

Graph RAG incorporates knowledge graph structures into the retrieval process:

1. **Knowledge Graph Construction**: Building structured relationships between entities
2. **Graph Embeddings**: Creating vector representations that capture relationship information
3. **Graph-Based Retrieval**: Finding relevant information by traversing relationships
4. **Graph-Augmented Generation**: Generating responses informed by structured knowledge

This approach offers "structured, context-rich data for more accurate AI-generated responses" by leveraging the relationships between data points (edges) which are "as useful and valuable as the data points (or vertices) themselves."[13]

### Hybrid RAG

Hybrid RAG combines multiple retrieval methods in a single architecture:

1. **Multiple Retrieval Paths**: Implementing several retrieval methods in parallel
2. **Diverse Document Sources**: Retrieving from different data stores
3. **Context Fusion**: Combining multiple retrieved contexts
4. **Enhanced Generation**: Using the fused context for improved responses

This approach offers greater flexibility and robustness by not relying on a single retrieval method.

### Agentic RAG (Router)

Agentic RAG with a router architecture uses AI agents to orchestrate the retrieval process:

1. **Query Analysis**: An AI agent analyzes the user query
2. **Routing Decision**: The agent routes the query to appropriate retrieval methods
3. **Multi-Source Retrieval**: Retrieving information from multiple specialized sources
4. **Context Integration**: Combining retrieved information
5. **Agent-Assisted Generation**: Using the combined context for response generation

This architecture "adds AI agents to the RAG pipeline to increase adaptability and accuracy."[14]

### Agentic RAG (Multi-Agent)

The most sophisticated RAG implementation employs multiple specialized agents:

1. **Task Decomposition**: Breaking complex queries into subtasks
2. **Specialized Agent Delegation**: Assigning subtasks to specialized agents
3. **Tool/API Integration**: Connecting agents to various tools and data sources
4. **Collaborative Reasoning**: Agents working together to solve complex queries
5. **Response Synthesis**: Combining agent outputs into a coherent response

This architecture allows "large language models (LLMs) to conduct information retrieval from multiple sources and handle more complex workflows."[22]
