# Resolving the Dependency Conflicts in Tourism RAG Chatbot

Based on the detailed error message, I can see there are significant version conflicts in your project dependencies. The primary issues involve incompatibilities between Pydantic, Jina, and Chainlit.

## Analysis of the Conflicts

The error shows two main incompatibilities:

1. **Pydantic Version Conflict**:
   - Your project requires `pydantic>=2.7.0`
   - But all versions of `jina>=3.25.0` require `pydantic<2.0.0`

2. **Uvicorn Compatibility Issue**:
   - Different versions of `chainlit` require different versions of `uvicorn`
   - `jina>=3.33.0` requires `uvicorn<=0.23.1`
   
These conflicts make it impossible to satisfy all dependencies simultaneously.

## Recommended Solution

I recommend the following solution that maintains core functionality while resolving conflicts:

## Key Changes Made to Resolve Conflicts

1. **Pydantic Downgrade**: 
   - Changed from `pydantic>=2.7.0` to `pydantic>=1.10.11,<2.0.0`
   - This resolves the primary conflict with Jina which requires Pydantic v1

2. **Jina Management**:
   - Removed Jina from main dependencies
   - Added a new optional dependency group `jina-extras` with `jina<3.25.0`
   - Kept `jina-reranker-client` in main dependencies for reranking functionality

3. **Chainlit Pin**:
   - Restricted Chainlit to `chainlit>=1.0.0,<2.0.0` to avoid Uvicorn conflicts

4. **PDM Resolution Overrides**:
   - Added explicit overrides for Pydantic and Uvicorn to ensure consistent versioning
   - Set Uvicorn to `>=0.23.2,<0.24.0` to be compatible with both Chainlit and Jina

5. **Feature Preservation**:
   - Added `modern-pydantic` optional dependency group for when you need Pydantic v2+ features without Jina
   - Kept all core RAG functionality intact (embeddings, reranking, vectorstore)

## How to Use This Solution

This solution takes a modular approach to resolve the conflicts:

1. **Core Functionality**: The main dependencies now have compatible versions that will work together

2. **Optional Features**:
   - When you need Jina: `pdm install -G jina-extras`
   - When you need modern Pydantic: `pdm install -G modern-pydantic` (don't use with Jina)

3. **Tourism Features**: Still available with `pdm install -G tourism`

4. **Development Tools**: Still available with `pdm install -G dev`

## Code Adaptation

You may need to make minor code adjustments:

1. Where you import Jina, add conditional imports:
   ```python
   try:
       import jina
       HAS_JINA = True
   except ImportError:
       HAS_JINA = False
       # Use alternative implementation
   ```

2. If you were using Pydantic v2-specific features, place them in conditional blocks:
   ```python
   try:
       from pydantic.v1 import BaseModel, Field
   except ImportError:
       from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
   ```

This solution balances compatibility with functionality while maintaining the core RAG capabilities of your tourism chatbot.
